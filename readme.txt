&quot;_The plugin&#39;s name could not be better. It really is simple to do 301 redirects. For example, if you modify the URL of one of your pages, then you can take the old URL and redirect it to the new one. Not only can this keep some SEO value, but it&#39;s good for user experience as well._&quot;

&quot;_I like this plugin because: You can quickly create 301 redirects without leaving your WordPress dashboard. It makes it much easier to manage your existing 301 redirects. It&#39;s just plain easier for beginners than digging around the .htaccess file._&quot;
